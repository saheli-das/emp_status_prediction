# emp_status_prediction
 company provided the data of its employees from 1985 to 2013 in 6 CSV files for analysis of employee data with the expectation to create an App for prediction of it's employees attrition
 
As part of this project I've created this Machine Learning App to predict if an employee/employees will stay in the company or leave the company. This App has the following key features: 
Interactive Input: Manual input of any employee or CSV upload for more than one employees

Consistent Preprocessing: Ensures data is processed the same way as during training

Visual Insights: Bar and pie charts for easy interpretation of results.
